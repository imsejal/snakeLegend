# snakeLegend
SnakeLegend is a classic Snake game implemented using vanilla JavaScript.
This simple and fun game allows players to control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with the game boundaries and itself.
# Game Controls
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake:
Up: Move the snake upward.
Down: Move the snake downward.
Left: Move the snake to the left.
Right: Move the snake to the right.

You can also use the W, A, S, D keys as an alternative control scheme:
W: Move the snake upward.
S: Move the snake downward.
A: Move the snake to the left.
D: Move the snake to the right.

# Game Rules
The objective of the game is to eat the food (indicated by a red square) that appears on the screen.
The snake starts with a length of 1.
Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer by 1 segment.
The game ends when the snake collides with the screen boundaries or itself.
Your score is determined by the number of food items eaten.

Enjoy playing SnakeLegend, and happy coding! üêçüéÆ
